## üèóÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Supabase account (free tier available)
- A Vercel account (optional, for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-fullstack-starter.git my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local

## üìÅ Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

### Root Directories
- `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `.husky/` - Git hooks
- `.storybook/` - Storybook configuration
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `public/` - Static files
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts
- `tests/` - Test files

### Source Directory (`src/`)

#### App Router (`app/`)
- `api/` - API routes
- `(auth)/` - Authentication pages
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard pages

#### Components (`components/`)
- `ui/` - UI components (shadcn)
- `layout/` - Layout components
- `forms/` - Form components
- `shared/` - Shared components

#### Other Source Directories
- `design-system/` - Design system
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `lib/` - Utility functions and clients
- `stories/` - Storybook stories
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run test` - Run Jest tests
- `npm run storybook` - Start Storybook
- `npm run create:page` - Generate a new page
- `npm run create:component` - Generate a new component

### Using Generator Scripts

This starter comes with helper scripts to quickly scaffold pages and components:

#### Creating a new page

```bash
# Create a new page at src/app/about/page.tsx
npm run create:page about

# Create a nested page at src/app/blog/posts/page.tsx
npm run create:page blog/posts
```

#### Creating a new component

```bash
# Create a new component with test file at src/components/shared/Button.tsx
npm run create:component Button
```

This will generate:
- `src/components/shared/Button.tsx` - The component file
- `src/components/shared/Button.test.tsx` - A test file for the component
